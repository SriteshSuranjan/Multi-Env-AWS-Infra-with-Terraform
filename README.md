# **Multi-Environment AWS Infrastructure with Terraform**  

## **Overview**  
This project leverages **Terraform** to automate the provisioning and management of AWS infrastructure across multiple environments, including **development, staging, and production**. It follows **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** best practices to ensure consistency, scalability, and efficient resource management.

## **Prerequisites**  
Before executing the Terraform scripts, ensure the following dependencies are installed:  

- [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads) (latest version recommended)  
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) (configured with valid credentials)  
- An AWS account with the necessary permissions to create resources  

## **Setup & Deployment**  

### **Step 1: Initialize Terraform**  
Initialize the Terraform workspace and download necessary provider plugins:  
```sh
terraform init
```

### **Step 2: Validate Configuration**  
Ensure the configuration files are correctly formatted and valid:  
```sh
terraform validate
```

### **Step 3: Plan Infrastructure Changes**  
Generate and review an execution plan before applying changes:  
```sh
terraform plan
```

### **Step 4: Deploy Infrastructure**  
Apply the Terraform configuration to create AWS resources:  
```sh
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

### **Step 5: Destroy Infrastructure (If Required)**  
To delete all deployed resources, run:  
```sh
terraform destroy -auto-approve
```

## **Features**  
✅ **Automated AWS provisioning** using Terraform  
✅ **Multi-environment support** for dev, staging, and production  
✅ **Scalability and reusability** through parameterized configurations  
✅ **Efficient state management** using Terraform state files  

## **Future Enhancements**  
- Implement **IAM roles and security policies**  
- Add **state locking mechanism** using S3 & DynamoDB backend  
- Expand support for **VPC, Load Balancers, and RDS**
